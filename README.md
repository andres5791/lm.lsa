lm.lsa permits to estimate linear regressions (based on lm()) using ILSA data from the supported studies: TIMSS, PIRLS, ICILS, ICCS, and PISA. That means, it supports the use of replicate weights and combining results with plausible values.

## Installation

You can install the development version of lm.lsa from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andres5791/lm.lsa")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(lm.lsa)
## basic example code
```
